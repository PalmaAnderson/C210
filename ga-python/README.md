# Genetic Algorithm (Python)

This algorithm attempts to find the minimum value of a the following 2-variable function:

Best individual: G = [00000 00000], F = [0, 0], Score = 1.000
```

Code was based on [henriqueblang](https://github.com/henriqueblang/optimization-ga)'s and [marcelovca90](https://github.com/marcelovca90/codigos-inatel/tree/master/C210/ga-java)'s implementations. Function plots were generated using [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+f%28x%2Cy%29%3Dx%5E2%2By%5E2%2C+x%3D-15+to+15%2C+y%3D-15+to+15).
