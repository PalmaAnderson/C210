# Search (Python)

This code solves the [sliding puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle) problem using either a [Breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search), [Depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) or a [Greedy algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm). The latter can use either the number of elements in the wrong position or the total [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) between current and state goals as a heuristic function.
